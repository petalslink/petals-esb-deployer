                  This model defines a set of service units to deploy on your Petals ESB bus. This model
                  will be mainly written by development teams because they have the knowledge of service units to
                  deploy.

                  can be used to perform the deployment of a Petals ESB bus. Such models are included in Petals ESB
                  distribution packs, and you can write your own.
